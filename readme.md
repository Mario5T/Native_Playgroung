# React Native Playground – Architecture & Documentation

This document explains the high-level architecture of a **React Native Playground** (similar to Expo Snack or CodeSandbox for RN). It includes diagrams (in Mermaid syntax, GitHub-compatible), component breakdowns, flows, and key considerations.

## 1. High-Level Architecture

  B3[iOS Device/Simulator]
end

  S2[Auth Service]
  S3[Project Service - CRUD + Metadata]
  S4[Storage (S3/GCS/Blob)]
  S5[Build Service (Metro/Babel/tsc)]
  S6[Bundler/Metro/Hermes bytecode]
  S7[Live Reload / WS Broker]
  S8[Sandbox Executor (containerized)]
  S9[CDN / Edge Cache]
  S10[Logs & Metrics (ELK/CloudWatch/Grafana)]
end

subgraph "Integrations"
  I1[VCS Import (GitHub/GitLab)]
  I2[Expo Services / OTA Updates]
  I3[Feature Flags]
end

## 2. Flow – Editing & Running Code

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant WebUI as Web UI (Editor)
  participant API as API Gateway
  participant Build as Build Service
  participant WS as Live Reload Broker
  participant Sandbox as Sandbox Executor
  participant Device as Device (Web/Android/iOS)

  User->>WebUI: Edit code
  WebUI->>API: Save Project
  API->>Build: Trigger build (Metro/Babel)
  Build->>Sandbox: Bundle & execute RN code
  Sandbox->>Device: Push app runtime
  WebUI->>WS: Connect for live reload
  User->>WebUI: Change code again
  WS->>Device: Hot reload bundle
```

## 3. Components Breakdown

### **Frontend (Client Side)**

* **Web Playground Editor**: Monaco/CodeMirror editor for JSX/JS.
* **Preview Panel**: iFrame/web view or device emulator.
* **Device Bridges**: iOS Simulator, Android Emulator, Web DOM.

### **Backend Services**

* **API Gateway**: Entry point for requests.
* **Auth Service**: OAuth (GitHub/Google) or JWT.
* **Project Service**: CRUD for code/projects.
* **Storage**: S3, GCS, or blob storage.
* **Build Service**: Runs Metro, Babel, TypeScript.
* **Bundler**: Produces RN bytecode (Hermes).
* **WS Broker**: Live reload / hot refresh.
* **Sandbox Executor**: Runs code in secure containers.
* **CDN**: Fast delivery of built bundles.
* **Monitoring**: Logs & metrics.

### **Integrations**

* **VCS Import**: Import repos from GitHub/GitLab.
* **Expo Services**: OTA updates.
* **Feature Flags**: Rollouts, experiments.

---

## 4. Security Considerations

* Sandbox execution with container isolation.
* Rate limiting on API Gateway.
* Authentication & RBAC.
* Monitoring + alerting.

---

## 5. Scaling Concerns

* CDN for bundles.
* Horizontal scaling of Sandbox Executors.
* Queue-based builds.
* Autoscaling for peak traffic.

---

## 6. Example API Contract (Simplified)

```http
POST /projects
{
  "name": "My RN Project",
  "files": { "App.js": "export default App;" }
}

GET /projects/{id}
GET /projects/{id}/build
```

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

* Latency < 200ms for edits.
* 99.9% uptime.
* Device fidelity (emulator = real device).

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

* **Infinite loops in code** → Timeout in Sandbox.
* **Abuse (crypto mining)** → Resource quotas.
* **Slow builds** → Incremental caching.

---

## 9. One-Liner for Stakeholders

> The React Native Playground provides an **instant coding sandbox** for RN apps with live preview on web and devices, powered by containerized builds, hot reload, and scalable cloud services.
